# TradeUp :: Demo

# Readme
####  Final Version of TradeUp, completed 6/

## Description
This contains the code for our application, an algorithmic trading simulator. 

## Bugs
Since Demo Day, Y!Finance seems to have modified its API to create very long delays for queries.  This is probably to fend off free-loaders, such as this application.  Unfortunately, this makes the application almost wholly impractical until someone can cough up the money to buy access to a real commercial-grade finance API.  However, all the infrastructure is in place, and if one were to ever buy a legit API, we could merge over in less than 25 lines of code.
